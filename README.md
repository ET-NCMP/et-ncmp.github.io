Review of uncertainty in in situ sea-surface temperature measurements

This is a review of uncertainty in in situ sea-surface temperature measurements. 
A traditional literature review gets out of date quickly. 
This is an attempt to write a review that can be brought up to date easily and regularly, 
while maintaining a history of the changes that have been made to it. In principle, anyone 
can take this repository and improve/change the review.

The text is based on Kennedy, J. J. (2014), A review of uncertainty in in situ measurements 
and data sets of sea surface temperature, Rev. Geophys., 52, 132
