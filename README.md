##Review of uncertainty in in situ sea-surface temperature measurements

This is a review of uncertainty in in situ sea-surface temperature measurements. 
A traditional literature review gets out of date quickly. 
This is an attempt to write a review that can be brought up to date easily and regularly, 
while maintaining a history of the changes that have been made to it. In principle, anyone 
can take this repository and improve/change the review.

The text is based on Kennedy, J. J. (2014), A review of uncertainty in in situ measurements 
and data sets of sea surface temperature, Rev. Geophys., 52, 132 
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013RG000434/abstract)

##How this works

This is still to be worked out in detail. The plan is to use issues as a basis for 
proposed changes to the text. Small changes can be made immediately where a new paper 
is published which fits easily into the existing structure. Larger changes can be discussed 
via comments before a larger change is made to the text. New sections can also be proposed 
and sketched out.

Once sufficient changes have been made, a "release" of the document will be made. This release can 
be archived and issued a doi via Zenodo. This will mean that the particular release is citable.

##Contributing

If you have a GitHub account, you can contribute by raising issues, joining the discussion on 
existing issues, or forking or cloning the repository to make your own changes. Doing this will 
ensure that your contributions are logged.

All constructive contributions will be acknowledged as contributors. Those making significant 
contributions to the text will be added as authors.
