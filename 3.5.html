<h1>3.5 Reconstruction Techniques and Other Structural Choices</h1>
<p>
Creating global SST analyses is challenging because of the relative sparseness of observations before the satellite era and the non-stationarity of the changing climate. A large number of different SST data sets based on in situ data have been produced employing a variety of statistical methods. The structural uncertainties associated with estimating SSTs in data voids and at data-sparse times are therefore somewhat better explored than structural uncertainties in the pervasive systematic errors. Data sets used in this paper have been summarized in Table 5 and global averages for these data sets are shown in Figure 5.
