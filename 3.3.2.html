<h1>3.3.2 Bias Adjustments 1941 to Present</h1>
<p>
In the post-1941 period, Folland and Parker [1995], Smith and Reynolds [2003], Smith and 
Reynolds [2005] and Rayner et al. [2006] opted not to adjust the data because they found 
no clear evidence of the need for adjustments. However, Rayner et al. [2006] did identify 
biases in Japanese and Dutch data after the Second World War that were as large as the 
biases before the war. Thompson et al. [2008] 
identified a discontinuity in global-average SST associated with a change in the composition 
of ICOADS release 2.1 in late 1945. Reynolds et al. [2010] quantified a relative bias 
between ship and drifting buoy measurements that they thought could lead to an artificial 
cooling of the global average SST. Kent et al. [1999] applied adjustments to ERI measurements, 
but removed the adjustment from later versions of their data set. 
</p><p>
Kennedy et al. [2011c], Hirahara et al. [2013] and Huang et al. [2015, 2016] developed bias 
adjustments for the period 1941 onwards. Kennedy et al. [2011c] used metadata from ICOADS, 
WMO Publication 47, observer instructions, technical reports and scientific papers to estimate 
biases for individual measurement types and to assign a measurement method to as many 
observations as possible. Hirahara et al. [2013] used a narrower range of metadata. By comparing 
subsamples of the data for which the metadata were known, they could estimate appropriate 
metadata assignments for the remainder. Huang et al. [2015, 2017] extended the method of Smith 
and Reynolds [2002] to the whole SST record.

To estimate the bias adjustments for long-term analyses, Kennedy et al. [2011] and Hirahara et 
al. [2013] require an understanding of how biases varied for individual components of the 
observing system. Several studies have examined ERI and bucket biases in ship data [Brooks, 1926; 
Brooks, 1928; Lumby, 1927; Collins et al., 1975; Wahl, 1948; Roll, 1951; Kirk and Gordon, 1952; 
Amot, 1954; Perlroth, 1962; Saur, 1963; Walden, 1966; Knudsen, 1966; Tauber, 1969; 
James and Fox, 1972; Tabata, 1978a, 1978b; Folland et al., 1993; Kent et al., 1993] but only 
Kent and Kaplan [2006] provide information that is time-resolved and traceable back to ICOADS. 
There is a single study of pervasive systematic errors in hull sensor measurements [Kent et al., 1993], 
which analyzed data from a small number of ships over a two year period and found that hull 
sensors were relatively unbiased and showed no systematic change of bias with depth.
</p><p>
In ERSSTv4 (Huang et al. [2015], Liu et al. [2015], Huang et al. [2016]) and ERSSTv5 
(Huang et al. [2017]), adjustments were applied to the full data set from the late nineteenth 
century to present. These were based on an extension of the Smith and Renolds [2003] method.
</p><p>
Few studies have looked at the long-term stability and calibration drifts of drifting 
buoys. Reverdin et al. [2010] installed 16 drifters with high quality temperature 
sensors in addition to their usual temperature sensors and found that the temperatures 
measured by the drifters showed inaccuracies that were larger than the 0.1K target 
accuracy and that they exhibited significant calibration drifts. This is consistent 
with the behavior seen by Atkinson et al. [2013].
