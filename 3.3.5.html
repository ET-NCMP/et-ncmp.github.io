<h1>3.3.5 Assessing the Efficacy of Bias Adjustments</h1>
<p>
The efficacy of the bias adjustments and their uncertainties are difficult to assess. Folland and Parker [1995] presented wind tunnel and ship board tests and also used their adjustments to estimate the differences between bucket and ERI measurements in broad latitude bands. These limited comparisons showed that their model could predict experimental results to better than 0.2 K. Folland and Salinger [1995] presented direct comparisons between air temperatures measured in New Zealand and SST measurements made nearby. Smith and Renyolds [2002] used oceanographic observations to assess their adjustments and those of Folland and Parker [1995]. In regions with sufficient observations they found that the magnitude of the Smith and Reynolds [2002] adjustments better explained the differences between SSTs and oceanographic observations, but the phase of the annual cycle was better captured by Folland and Parker [1995]. Hanawa et al. [2000] showed that the Folland and Parker [1995] adjustments improved the agreement between Japanese ship data and independent SST data from Japanese coastal stations in two periods: before and after the Second World War. However, the collection of ship data (COADS and Kobe collections) used in Hanawa et al. [2000] might not have had the same bias characteristics as assumed by Folland and Parker [1995] (based on the Met Office Marine Data Bank) in developing their adjustments. Other long term coastal records of water temperature exist. Some of these [Hanna et al., 2006; MacKenzie and Schiedek, 2007; Cannaby and Hüsrevoğlu, 2009] have been compared to open ocean SST analyses (though not with the express intention of assessing bias adjustments), others have not [Maul et al., 2001; Nixon et al., 2004; Breaker et al. 2005].

More recently, Matthews [2013] and Matthews and Matthews [2013] reported field measurements of SST made using different buckets and simultaneous thermo-salinograph measurements. They found negligible biases between different buckets, but their experimental design involved larger buckets and shorter measurement times than were used in Folland and Parker [1995]. Nevertheless, this highlights the potential for well-designed field experiments to improve understanding of historical biases.

Carella et al. [2017b], performed tests of the Folland and Parker [1995] bucket model in a laboratory. They were able to test the dependency of heat loss (and gain) on wind speed and air-sea temperature difference, but did not vary the exposure to solar radiation. They found that the models performed reasonably well, but that minor changes in behaviour, such as whether the sample was stirred, could change the rate of measured heat loss. They compared the modelled heat loss to earlier test data gathered by Ashford [1948] and Roll [1951] which suggested that heat loss was also dependent on whether the air flow round the bucket was laminar or turbulent.

An analysis by Gouretski et al. [2012] compared SST observations with near-surface measurements (0-20 m depth) taken from oceanographic profiles. It shows that the overall shape of the global average is consistent between the two independent analyses, but that there are differences of around 0.1 K between 1950 and 1970. These are most likely attributable to residual biases, although, as noted above, actual physical differences between the sea surface and the 0-20 m layer cannot be ruled out. Similar differences are seen when comparing SST with the average over the 0-20 m layer of the analysis of Palmer et al. [2007] (not shown).

Since the late 1940s, global and hemispheric average SST anomalies calculated separately from adjusted bucket measurements and adjusted ERI measurements showed consistent long-term and short-term changes [Kennedy et al., 2011c]. From the 1990s, there are also plentiful observations from drifting and moored buoys.
</p><p>
In contrast to the modern period, the period before 1950 is characterized by a much less diverse observing fleet. During the Second World War, the majority of measurements were ERI measurements. Before the war, buckets were the primary means by which SST observations were made. This makes it very difficult to compare simultaneous independent subsets of the data. In periods with fewer independent measurement types, it might be possible to use changes in environmental conditions such as day-night differences or air-sea temperature differences to diagnose systematic errors in the data.

Qualitative agreement between the long-term behavior of different global temperature measures  including NMAT, SST and land temperatures  gives a generally consistent picture of historical global temperature change (Figure 5), but a direct comparison is less informative about uncertainty in the magnitude of the trends. Kent et al. [2013] showed similar temporal evolution of NMAT and SST in broad latitude bands in the northern hemisphere and tropics. However there are differences of up to 0.4 K in the band from 55&deg;S to 15&deg;S between 1940 and 1960. Studies such as that by Folland [2005] can be used to make more quantitative comparisons. Folland [2005] compared measured land air temperatures with land air temperatures from an atmosphere-only climate model that had observed SSTs (with and without bucket adjustments) as a boundary forcing. He found much better agreement when the SSTs were adjusted. Atmospheric reanalyses also use observed SSTs along with other observed meteorological variables to infer a physically consistent estimate of land surface air temperatures. Simmons et al. [2010] showed that land air temperatures from a reanalysis driven by observed SSTs were very close to those of CRUTEM3 [Brohan et al., 2006] over the period 1973 to 2008. Compo et al. [2013] showed similar results for the whole of the twentieth century although the agreement was not quite so close. Although their intention was to show that land temperatures were reliable, their results indicate that there is broad consistency between observed SSTs and land temperatures.
