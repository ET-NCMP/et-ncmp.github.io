    <h1>Errors in variables other than SST</h1>
    <p>
      Uncertainties in marine reports in variables other than SST can also be important. For example, even if the measured SST 
      is "correct", a mis-reported location will cause an apparent error in the SST. Locations and times of reports may 
      be incorrect for a number of reasons. 
    </p><p>	
      Location errors - imprecise locations, locations provided to limited resolution. In some cases, latitude and longitude 
      are given in ICOADS to a lower resolution than can be coded e.g. 0.1 degree or even 0.5 degrees. This naturally 
      introduces errors, potentially significant, into the geolocation of marine reports. In areas where SST gradients 
      are high, this can lead to significant errors in the estimated SST and any other derived values such as anomalies.
    </p><p>
	  In early reports, position was estimated by dead reckoning between more accurate, but less frequent positional fixes. 
	  This can be seen in some early reports as periodic "jumps" in ship location from the accumulated error in the dead 
	  reckoned position to the more certain position. Dai et al. [2019] analysed a year of data (1885) for a subset of ships 
	  and found uncertainties in latitude and longitude of 0.20deg and 0.29deg respectively. This translated to an 
	  uncertainty in the measured SST of around 0.1K to more than 1K in regions of high SST variability.
	</p><p>
  	  Time errors - measurements made at a time other than that reported. lag in recording of temperature e.g using a previously 
	  recorded temperature to fill out the log. where through hull sensors used, there can be a lag owing to the thermal 
	  inertia of the hull.
