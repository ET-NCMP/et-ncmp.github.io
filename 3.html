<h1>The Current State of Uncertainty in in situ SST Analyses</h1>
<p>
The classification of uncertainties outlined in <a href="2.html">Section 2</a> will now be used as a framework to assess uncertainties in the global data sets based on in situ measurements. Preliminary to this it will be helpful to define what exactly is meant by sea-surface temperature.
