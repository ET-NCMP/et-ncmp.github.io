<h1>3.3 Pervasive Systematic Errors and Biases</h1>
<p>
Kent et al. [2010] conducted a review of literature on pervasive systematic errors (often termed ‘biases’) in in situ SST measurements. Many studies have looked at the differences in pervasive systematic errors between measurement methods, but fewer have attempted to adjust SST records to minimize the effects of changes in instrumentation.
