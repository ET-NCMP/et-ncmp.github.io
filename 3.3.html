<h1>3.3 Pervasive Systematic Errors and Biases</h1>
<p>
Kent et al. [2017] gives a detailed review of literature on pervasive systematic errors 
(often termed "biases") in in situ SST measurements. They lay out many of the difficulties 
associated with quantifying biases in historical SST measurements. They make nine 
recommendations for how understanding can be advanced. Many studies have looked at the 
differences (Kent et al. 2010 provides an earlier review) in pervasive systematic errors 
between measurement methods, but fewer have attempted to adjust SST records to minimize 
the effects of changes in instrumentation.
