	<h1>Quality control</h1>
	<p>
	quality control. quality control is the removal of observations that are grossly in error such that they are effectively 
  unrelated to the true SST. This includes values that 
  have been corrupted in transmission, badly transcribed (say by a misplaced decimal), made with faulty instruments, etc. 
  It also includes removal of observations which are related to the true SST, but for which the error is larger than is 
  desired for a particular application.
	</p><p>
  Quality control and uncertainty calculation are linked because the size of expected uncertainties in the measurements 
  is used to guide the development of quality control procedures. Contrariwise, the stringency of the quality control can 
  affect the estimated uncertainties by reducing the variance of the measurements.
  </p><p>
  There are a number of quality control systems. ICOADS uses trimming. There is IQUAM (Xu and Ignatov). Other data sets 
  employ there own QC procedures, such as COBE-SST-2, HadSST4.
