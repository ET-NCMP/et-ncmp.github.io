<h1>7 Concluding Remarks and Future Directions</h1>
<p>
One of the chief difficulties in assessing the uncertainties in SST data sets is the 
impossibility of tracing individual observations back via an unbroken chain to international 
measurement standards. The creation of a global array of reference stations or buoys each making 
simultaneous redundant measurements (such as the triple measurements made at CRN stations, 
Diamond et al. 2013) of a variety of marine variables could solve some of the 
problems of SST analysis that have bedeviled the understanding of historical SST change and 
would provide a gold standard against which the future wider observing system, incorporating 
observations from ships, buoys, profiling floats and satellites can be assessed. Even without 
such traceability a climate record could be more easily maintained by stricter adherence to 
the Global Climate Observing System [GCOS 2003] climate monitoring principles.
</p><p>
In the absence of such a network the estimation of uncertainties has depended heavily on 
redundancies in measurement systems and in analysis techniques. Full use of the redundancies 
is now being made in the modern period via comparisons of the many available satellite sources 
with each other and with in situ sources [O'Carroll et al., 2008; Merchant et al., 2012, 
Hausfather et al. 2017] and sub-surface data [Gille, 2012, Huang et al. 2018]. Analyses that 
ingest a variety of data sources can produce bias 
statistics for each of the inputs [Brasnett, 2008; Xu and Ignatov, 2010, 2014]. Such information can 
be exploited to assess their relative quality and, as the analyses are pushed further back in 
time [Roberts-Jones et al., 2012], they will help assess uncertainties through a larger part 
of the record.
</p><p>
SSTs are physically related to other measurements including surface pressures and winds, 
salinity, air temperatures, sub-surface temperatures and ocean biology amongst others. Information 
from SST can be supplemented by analyses based on physical understanding of the climate system. 
It has already been shown that by combining information from night marine air temperatures with 
SST it was possible to greatly reduce uncertainties in early 20th and late 19th century SST. Yu 
et al. [2004] used a joint estimation method to minimize uncertainties in flux estimates based 
on a range of different variables mostly based on satellite data. Other studies [Tung and Zhou, 
2010; Deser et al., 2010] have used physical reasoning based on a host of variables to explore 
uncertainties in the long-term trends of tropical Pacific SSTs first raised by Vecchi et al. [2008]. 
It has even been suggested that proxy records such as isotope ratios from corals and ice cores could 
be used, with appropriate care, to understand uncertainties in the longest-term changes in SST 
[Anderson et al., 2013]. The most advanced exemplars of physical and statistical synthesis are ocean 
and coupled reanalyses which will play an increasingly important role in understanding observational 
uncertainty and long-term climate change.
</p><p>
A key barrier to understanding SST uncertainty is a lack of appropriate metadata. Better information 
is needed concerning how measurements were made, which method was used to make a particular 
observation, calibration information, the depths at which observations were made, and even basic 
information such as the call sign or name of the ship that made a particular observation.
</p><p>
Some of this information can be inferred from data already contained in marine reports. Where 
reports in ICOADS cannot be associated with a particular ship, either because they have a missing 
ID, or a generic ID, there is much to be gained by grouping observations to give plausible ship 
tracks, or voyages (Carella et al. 2017a). By using data association techniques to infer such 
metadata from the location information and other clues such as how frequently observations were 
made and which variables were observed, it should be possible to assess systematic and uncorrelated 
errors on a ship-by-ship basis going back to the start of the record and even infer likely 
measurement methods based on characteristic variations of the measurements with the meteorological 
conditions (Carella et al. 2018).
</p><p>
A more systematic approach to the assessment of analysis techniques is needed to elucidate the 
reasons for the differences between analyses and to assess the verisimilitude of analysis uncertainty 
estimates. Approaches could include theoretical inter-comparisons of statistical methods, comparisons 
based on well-defined sets of common input observations, and benchmarks built from datasets (such as 
model output) where the truth is known a piori. Benchmark tests like those planned by the International 
Surface Temperature Initiative [Thorne et al. 2011b] provide an objective measure against which analysis 
techniques can be evaluated. Both analysis techniques and benchmarks will have to be tailored 
appropriately for the particular problems affecting SST measurements and the latest understanding 
of measurement uncertainties.
</p><p>
A key weakness of historical SST data sets is the lack of attention paid to evaluating the effects 
of data biases particularly in the post-1941 records. Further independent estimates of the biases 
produced need to be undertaken using as diverse a range of means as possible and the robust 
critique of existing methods must continue. Ideally, these would be complemented by 
carefully-designed field tests of buckets and other measurement methods.
</p><p>
A community review paper on SST biases (Kent et al. 2017) made a number of recommendations:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Add more data and metadata to ICOADS.</li>
<li>Reprocess existing ICOADS records.</li>
<li>Improve information on observational methods.</li>
<li>Improve physical models of SST bias.</li>
<li>Improve statistical models of SST bias.</li>
<li>Maintain and extend the range of different estimates of SST bias.</li>
<li>Expand data sources for validation and extend use of measures of internal consistency in validation.</li>
<li>Ensure adequacy and continuity of the observing system.</li>
<li>Improve openness and access to information.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Combining new analysis techniques that have been appropriately benchmarked with novel approaches 
to assessing uncertainty arising from systematic errors, pervasive systematic errors and their 
adjustments will give new end-to-end analyses that will help to explore the uncertainties in 
historical SSTs in a more systematic manner.
</p><p>
For long-term historical analyses, there is no substitute for actual observations and relevant 
metadata. Efforts to identify archives of marine observations and digitize them are ongoing 
[Brohan et al., 2009; Wilkinson et al., 2011]. Such programs are labor intensive, first in 
identifying and cataloguing the holdings in archives around the world, then in creating and 
storing digital images of the paper books and finally in keying the observations. The difficulty 
of decoding hand written entries in a variety of languages, formats and scripts means that 
optical character recognition technologies are of limited use. A number of popular crowd-sourcing 
projects have been started to key information from ships logs that have historical as well 
meteorological interest. OldWeather.org has keyed data from Royal Navy logs from the First World 
War [Brohan et al., 2009] and is now working on logs from polar expeditions. Digitization of data 
also holds the possibility of extending instrumental records further back in time 
[Brohan et al., 2010]. New observations, with reliable metadata, can be used not only to reduce 
uncertainty in SST analyses, but also to test the reliability of existing interpolated products 
and their uncertainties.
</p><p>
The ultimate destination of newly digitized observations is the International Comprehensive Ocean 
Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) [Woodruff et al., 2011]. The ICOADS repository of marine meteorological 
data has long been the focus of advances in the understanding of marine climatology. It provides a 
consistent baseline for a wide range of studies, providing a solid basis for traceability and 
reproducibility. The continued existence, maintenance and improvement of ICOADS are essential to 
the future understanding of the global climate.
</p><p>
Finally, the work of identifying and quantifying uncertainties will be pointless, if those 
uncertainties are not used. Uncertainty estimates provided with data sets have sometimes been 
difficult to use or easy to use inappropriately. As pointed out by Rayner et al. [2009], "more 
reliable and user-friendly representations of uncertainty should be provided" in order to encourage 
their widespread and effective use.
