<h1>3.2.3 Summary of Individual Observational Errors</h1>
<p>
Many estimates of uncertainties of ship and buoy SST measurements have been made. A typical SST measurement made by a ship has an uncertainty of around 1-1.5K and a drifting buoy observation a typical uncertainty of around 0.1-0.7K. More recent studies split these uncertainties into uncorrelated and systematic components, which better describe the error characteristics of these platforms. However, a lack of metadata, most particularly ship call signs, hampers the application of such an error model and it does not capture behavior seen in SST measurements such as non-Normal distributions or systematic errors that vary on time scales from months to years.
