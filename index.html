       Based on <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013RG000434/abstract">Kennedy, J. J. (2014), A 
		review of uncertainty in in situ measurements and data sets of sea surface temperature, Rev. Geophys., 
		52, 132, doi:10.1002/2013RG000434</a>. A review can only provide a snapshot of the literature, but 
		there is an advantage in having a review that is updated as the literature evolves. The text of this 
		review is under version control and the files can be found on 
		<a href="https://github.com/ET-NCMP/et-ncmp.github.io">github</a>. The review can be read as a 
		regular web page using <a href="https://et-ncmp.github.io/index.html">GitHub pages</a>. 
		As new papers and other resources become available, the text will be updated.

		rewrite a section, propose a change to the structure, point out new papers, typos or anything else, 
		then there are a number of ways this can be acheived. Set up a github account and raise an issue or

		Archives of in situ sea surface temperature (SST) measurements extend back more than 160 years. 
		Quality of the measurements is variable, and the area of the oceans they sample is limited, especially 
		early in the record and during the two world wars. Measurements of SST and the gridded data sets that 
		are based on them are used in many applications so understanding and estimating the uncertainties are 
		vital. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the various components that contribute to the 
		overall uncertainty of SST measurements made in situ and of the data sets that are derived from them. 
		In doing so, it also aims to identify current gaps in understanding. Uncertainties arise at the level 
		of individual measurements with both systematic and random effects and, although these have been 
		extensively studied, refinement of the error models continues. Recent improvements have been made in 
		the understanding of the pervasive systematic errors that affect the assessment of long-term trends and 
		variability. However, the adjustments applied to minimize these systematic errors are uncertain and 
		these uncertainties are higher before the 1970s and particularly large in the period surrounding the 
		Second World War owing to a lack of reliable metadata. The uncertainties associated with the choice of 
		statistical methods used to create globally complete SST data sets have been explored using different 
		analysis techniques, but they do not incorporate the latest understanding of measurement errors, and 
		they want for a fair benchmark against which their skill can be objectively assessed. These problems 
		can be addressed by the creation of new end-to-end SST analyses and by the recovery and digitization of 
		data and metadata from ship log books and other contemporary literature.
