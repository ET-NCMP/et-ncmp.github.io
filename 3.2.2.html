<h1>3.2.2 Random and Systematic Measurement Errors</h1>
<p>
Kent and Berry [2008] and Kennedy et al. [2011a, 2011b] decomposed the observational errors into random and systematic components. Brasnett [2008] and Xu and Ignatov [2010] implicitly used the same error model  their analyses output the same statistics produced by Kent and Berry [2008]  and the results are indeed very similar (Figure 3). Estimates are summarized in Table 4. The possibility of correlated measurement errors is also implicitly allowed for by Ishii et al. [2003] and Hirahara et al. [2013] who merge observations from a single ship into a super observation before calculating uncertainties. Adding the uncertainties in quadrature gives a combined observational uncertainty of between 1 and 1.5 K, consistent with earlier estimates (Table 1) that did not differentiate between the two.

In the studies listed in Table 4, the systematic component of the error was assumed to be different for each ship, but this does not on its own capture the effects of pervasive systematic errors. The data from Kent and Berry [2008], Brasnett [2008] and Xu and Ignatov [2010] also show that the systematic observational error component for some ships varies from month to month suggesting that the partitioning of systematic and random effects is also a function of the time period considered.

The addition of a systematic component has a pronounced effect on the uncertainty of large-scale averages comprising many observations. Kennedy et al. [2011b] estimated that the effect of the correlations between errors was to increase the uncertainty of the global annual average SST anomaly due to measurement error from 0.01 K (uncorrelated case) to more than 0.05 K in the 19th Century and to more than 0.01 K even in the well-observed modern period when millions of observations contribute to the annual global average (see Figure 8). Systematic errors could also have a pronounced effect on reconstructions when they project onto large-scale modes of variability, or on the estimation of EOFs. However, because of the assumed independence of the errors between ships, the correlated component of the uncertainty remains relatively unimportant for the analysis of long-term trends of large-scale averages. Pervasive systematic errors, which are correlated across a large proportion of the global fleet, (section 3.2) are far more important from that point of view.

One of the difficulties with estimating the uncertainties associated with systematic errors from individual ships is that not all observations in ICOADS can be associated with an individual ship. Some of the reports have no more information than a location, time and SST measurement. Kennedy et al. [2011b] had to make estimates of how the uncertainty arising from systematic errors behaved as the number of observations increased by considering the behavior at times when the majority of reports contained a ship name or call-sign. They assumed that observations without call signs behaved in the same way. Kent and Berry [2008] suggested that only ship reports with extant metadata be used in climate analyses of the modern period to minimize such ambiguities. For earlier periods, the gains in improved quantification of uncertainty would need to be balanced against the increased uncertainty arising from reduced coverage.

Many gridded SST data sets and analyses, as well as the studies that depend on them, assume that the observational errors are normally distributed, but this is not necessarily the case for individual observations. Kennedy et al. [2011a] investigated the properties of observations that had been quality controlled using the procedures described in Rayner et al. [2006]. They found that in comparisons with satellite observations the distributions of errors were 'fat-tailed' with the distribution of errors having a positive kurtosis. In the creation of gridded data sets from SST observations, the effects of outliers can be minimized somewhat by the use of resistant or robust statistics such as Winsorised, or trimmed means (see e.g., Rayner et al. [2006]). The effect of outliers is further reduced in large scale averages and the distribution of errors in large scale averages tends towards a normal distribution as the number of observations increases [Kennedy et al., 2011a].
