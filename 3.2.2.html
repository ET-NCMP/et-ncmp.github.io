<h1>3.2.2 Uncorrelated and Systematic Measurement Errors</h1>
<p>
Kent and Berry [2008] and Kennedy et al. [2011a, 2011b] decomposed the observational 
errors into uncorrelated and systematic components. Brasnett [2008] and Xu and Ignatov 
[2010] implicitly used the same error model  their analyses output the same statistics 
produced by Kent and Berry [2008]  and the results are indeed very similar (Figure 3). 
Estimates are summarized in Table 4. The possibility of correlated measurement errors 
is also implicitly allowed for by Ishii et al. [2003] and Hirahara et al. [2013] who 
merge observations from a single ship into a super observation before calculating 
uncertainties. Adding the uncertainties in quadrature gives a combined observational 
uncertainty of between 1 and 1.5 K, consistent with earlier estimates (Table 1) that 
did not differentiate between the two.

In the studies listed in Table 4, the systematic component of the error was assumed to be 
different for each ship, but this does not on its own capture the effects of pervasive 
systematic errors. The data from Kent and Berry [2008], Brasnett [2008] and Xu and Ignatov 
[2010] also show that the systematic observational error component for some ships varies 
from month to month suggesting that the partitioning of systematic and uncorrelated effects 
is also a function of the time period considered.

The addition of a systematic component has a pronounced effect on the uncertainty of 
large-scale averages comprising many observations. Kennedy et al. [2011b] estimated 
that the effect of the correlations between errors was to increase the uncertainty of 
the global annual average SST anomaly due to measurement error from 0.01 K (uncorrelated 
case) to more than 0.05 K in the 19th Century and to more than 0.01 K even in the 
well-observed modern period when millions of observations contribute to the annual 
global average (see Figure 8).
</p><p>
Berry and Kent [2017] used an error model that combined both uncorrelated and systematic 
effects to assess the adequacy of the marine observing network. They found that metrics 
which rely solely on counts of observations in a grid cell or similar area (Zhang et al. 
2006, Zhang et al. 2009) typically can 
misestimate the adequacy of the network because they do not take into account the 
effect of systematic biases. They found that simply increasing observation counts for SST 
was not the best way of reducing uncertainty and that increasing the number of ships or 
buoys was better.
</p><p>
Systematic errors could also have a pronounced effect 
on reconstructions when they project onto large-scale modes of variability, or on the 
estimation of EOFs. However, because of the assumed independence of the errors between 
ships, the correlated component of the uncertainty remains relatively unimportant for 
the analysis of long-term trends of large-scale averages. Pervasive systematic errors, 
which are correlated across a large proportion of the global fleet, (section 3.2) are far 
more important from that point of view.
</p><p>
One of the difficulties with estimating the uncertainties associated with systematic errors 
from individual ships is that not all observations in ICOADS can be associated with an 
individual ship. Some of the reports have no more information than a location, time and SST 
measurement. Kennedy et al. [2011b] had to make estimates of how the uncertainty arising 
from systematic errors behaved as the number of observations increased by considering the 
behavior at times when the majority of reports contained a ship name or call-sign. They 
assumed that observations without call signs behaved in the same way. Kent and Berry [2008] 
suggested that only ship reports with extant metadata be used in climate analyses of the modern 
period to minimize such ambiguities. For earlier periods, the gains in improved quantification 
of uncertainty would need to be balanced against the increased uncertainty arising from reduced 
coverage.
</p><p>
Carella et al. [2017] developed an algorithm to assemble ship tracks from marine reports 
that have missing, non-unique, incorrect or otherwise confusing ID information in ICOADS. 
They found that they could significantly increase the fraction of observations assigned to 
coherent tracks for much of the record. They note that the new track assignments could be 
used to improve estimates of measurement error uncertainty, help with bias adjustment, quality 
control and data assimilation.
</p><p>
Many gridded SST data sets and analyses, as well as the studies that depend on them, assume 
that the observational errors are normally distributed, but this is not necessarily the case 
for individual observations. Kennedy et al. [2011a] investigated the properties of observations 
that had been quality controlled using the procedures described in Rayner et al. [2006]. They 
found that in comparisons with satellite observations the distributions of errors were 'fat-tailed' 
with the distribution of errors having a positive kurtosis. In the creation of gridded data sets 
from SST observations, the effects of outliers can be minimized somewhat by the use of resistant 
or robust statistics such as Winsorised, or trimmed means (see e.g., Rayner et al. [2006]). 
The effect of outliers is further reduced in large scale averages and the distribution of 
errors in large scale averages tends towards a normal distribution as the number of observations 
increases [Kennedy et al., 2011a].
