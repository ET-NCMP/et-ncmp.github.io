<h1>3.2 Individual Observational Errors</h1>
<p>
The general quality of raw SST measurements recorded in digital archives is mixed. Consequently, all SST analyses perform a stage of pre-screening, or quality control (QC) in order to remove observations of low quality and minimize the number of egregious errors. The size of the uncertainties of individual measurements will depend to a certain extent on the QC that is applied but the effects of differences in QC have not been assessed systematically.
